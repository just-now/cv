 Distributed object store. Remote work, globally distributed team.

 https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr

 Involved into develpement of distributed object storage system
 designed for great efficiency, massive capacity, and high
 HDD-utilization.

 Technologies: C, asm, python, bash, various cluster hardware, network
               and storage controllers such as Mellanox Connectx-5,
               Seagate Exos X 5U84, Supermicro TR4, PCI busses, HBAs,
               simd.

 - 2020 - 2022: Distributed transaction management team lead (4 engineers);
 - 2019 - 2020: Performance team lead (8-15 engineers);
 - 2018 - 2022: A part of architectural group. Software product
   design, including requirements gathering, use-case definition,
   milestone planning, and integration with complementary
   subsystems. Communication of technical decisions, development plans
   to software developers, team leads, product management.
 - RAID NxPxK library design and implementation;
 - Distributed configuration component implementation;
 - Preemptive locking primitive design and implementation;
 - "Parity-math" component as a part of SNS-repair (from HLD to TESTING);
 - HLD and DLD development of "rpc-layer" component;
 - Misc. tasks from CODE to TESTING like lib improvement, etc;
 - Transaction engine component design and implementation;
 - Designed implementation plan for the transaction engine integration
   (overall work was around ~5k hours);
 - Designed and implemented btree persistent structure;
 - Designed approaches (based on existing but with significant project
   specifics) allowing to increase parallelism level for storage
   structures of transaction engine;
 - Performance tuning and optimization in different contexts: from
   application to system-wide;
 - Page Daemon design and implementation;
 - Designed implementation plan for the Page Daemon component
   integration (an alternative was to rewrite the whole project code
   base);
 - Distributed transaction manager detailed level design (high level
   design was proposed by the architect);
 - Different kinds of library algorithms and improvements mostly
   related to parallel and asynchronous programming (ex:
   parallel_for() implementation, async termination implementation,
   etc);
 - Different kinds of scientific work like system performance modeling
   (queuing theory);
 - Designed and implemented distributed profiler;
 - Designed and lead implementation of the cluster-wide performance
   harness (telemetry).
 - Data/metadata corruption debugging in distributed system.
